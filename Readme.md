# Overview

{Important! Do not say in this section that this is college assignment. Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

In this program I go over a number of basic topics that you would need to know in order to program in Rust. These topics include variables, expressions, conditionals, loops, functions, and an example of how to use slicing. It will show you how to use each as well as some of the ways that you can display these different topics to the user.

The Rust program that I have written is meant to be used as a teaching example that would help people new to the laguage understand some of the basic syntax that will be standard in almost any program that they will create. As well as, introduce some other topics that can be complex, but given in simple/easy to follow examples.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- I think that having a better layout, and possibly building an interface into would make it better.
- I could add in an example of how to use data structures in Rust.
- I think I could improve the program by making it a little more interactive, taking in inputs from the user, but not too much because I want to keep the program very simple.
